# 📏 Retrieval Metrics Deep Dive

## 📌 Overview

Retrieval metrics evaluate how effectively a system retrieves relevant documents or passages for a given query.

They are critical in:
- Search systems  
- Recommendation systems  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

---

## 🧠 Why Retrieval Metrics Matter

In GenAI systems:

- Poor retrieval → hallucination  
- Missing context → incomplete answers  
- Wrong ranking → degraded quality  

> Retrieval quality directly impacts LLM output quality.

---

## 🧩 Types of Retrieval Metrics

### 1. Rank-aware Metrics
These consider **position of results**:
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
- Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)

---

### 2. Rank-unaware Metrics
These consider only **presence of relevant results**:
- Precision@K
- Recall@K

---

📚 Reference:  
Rank-aware metrics consider both relevance and order, while others only count relevant items. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

---

## 🎯 Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

### 📌 Definition

MRR measures how quickly the **first relevant result** appears in the ranking.

---

### Formula

\[
MRR = \frac{1}{|Q|} \sum_{i=1}^{|Q|} \frac{1}{rank_i}
\]

Where:
- \( rank_i \) = position of first relevant result
- \( Q \) = number of queries

---

### Intuition

- If correct answer is at rank 1 → score = 1  
- Rank 2 → score = 0.5  
- Rank 5 → score = 0.2  

---

### Example

```
Query: "What is HbA1c?"

Retrieved Results:
1. "HbA1c definition" ✅
2. "Glucose explanation"
3. "Cholesterol levels"

Reciprocal Rank = 1/1 = 1.0
```

---

```
Query: "Normal glucose level?"

Retrieved Results:
1. "Cholesterol"
2. "Blood pressure"
3. "Glucose levels" ✅

Reciprocal Rank = 1/3 ≈ 0.33
```

---

### Final MRR

```
MRR = (1 + 0.33) / 2 = 0.665
```

---

### When to Use MRR

- Question-answering systems  
- Search systems with **single correct answer**  
- Chatbots  

---

### Key Insight

- Focuses ONLY on first relevant result  
- Ignores rest of ranking  

📚 References:  
- MRR evaluates position of first relevant item :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Reciprocal rank is inverse of position :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

---

### Limitations

- Ignores multiple relevant results

---

### Limitations

- Ignores multiple relevant results  
- Not suitable when multiple answers matter  

---

## 📊 Precision@K

### 📌 Definition

Precision@K measures how many of the top-K retrieved results are relevant.

---

### Formula

\[
Precision@K = \frac{\text{Number of relevant items in top K}}{K}
\]

---

### Example

```
Top 5 results:
[Relevant, Not Relevant, Relevant, Relevant, Not Relevant]

Precision@5 = 3 / 5 = 0.6
```

---

### When to Use

- When quality of top results matters  
- Search systems  
- RAG (top-k retrieval)  

---

## 📊 Recall@K

### 📌 Definition

Recall@K measures how many of the total relevant items are retrieved in top-K results.

---

### Formula

\[
Recall@K = \frac{\text{Relevant items retrieved}}{\text{Total relevant items}}
\]

---

### Example

```
Total relevant documents = 4

Retrieved top 5:
3 relevant

Recall@5 = 3 / 4 = 0.75
```

---

### Key Insight

- Precision → quality  
- Recall → coverage  

---

## 🎯 Keyword Coverage

### 📌 Definition

Keyword coverage measures whether retrieved documents contain important query terms.

---

### Example

```
Query: "high glucose level"

Retrieved document:
"Glucose levels are elevated"

Coverage:
- "glucose" → present
- "high" → implied
- "level" → present

High keyword coverage
```

---

### Use Cases

- Simple retrieval validation  
- Debugging retrieval systems  
- Baseline metric  

---

### Limitations

- Ignores semantic meaning  
- Cannot capture synonyms or context  

---

## 🎯 Hit Rate (Hit@K)

### 📌 Definition

Measures whether at least one relevant result appears in top-K.

---

### Formula

```
Hit@K = 1 if at least one relevant result exists, else 0
```

---

### Example

```
Top 5 results:
[Not Relevant, Not Relevant, Relevant, Not Relevant, Not Relevant]

Hit@5 = 1
```

---

### When to Use

- QA systems  
- Chatbots  
- First-result importance  

---

## ⚖️ Comparing Metrics

| Metric | Measures | Use Case |
|-------|--------|---------|
| MRR | First relevant result | QA systems |
| NDCG | Ranking quality | RAG, search |
| Precision@K | Top-K accuracy | Search |
| Recall@K | Coverage | Large datasets |
| Hit@K | Presence of answer | QA systems |
| Keyword Coverage | Term matching | Debugging |

---

## 🧠 How Metrics Work Together (Real Systems)

### Typical RAG Evaluation Stack

- Hit@K → Did we retrieve anything useful?  
- MRR → How early did we retrieve it?  
- NDCG → Was ranking correct?  
- Precision@K → Are top results good?  
- Recall@K → Did we miss anything?  

---

### Example Evaluation Pipeline

```
Query → Retrieve top-K documents
       → Compute metrics:
           - Hit@K
           - MRR
           - NDCG
           - Precision@K
           - Recall@K
```

---

## 🏭 Industry Practice

In production systems:

- Use multiple metrics together  
- Monitor trends over time  
- Combine with human evaluation  
- Use offline + online evaluation  

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

- Using only one metric  
- Ignoring ranking order  
- Not defining ground truth properly  
- Over-optimizing for precision but hurting recall  
- Ignoring semantic relevance  

---

## 💡 Key Insight

> No single metric is sufficient. A combination of ranking, accuracy, and coverage metrics is required to evaluate retrieval systems effectively.
