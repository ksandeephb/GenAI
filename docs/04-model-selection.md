## 📌 Overview

Model selection is a critical step in designing Generative AI systems. The choice of model impacts:

- Accuracy  
- Latency  
- Cost  
- Scalability  
- Compliance  

---

## 🧠 Why Model Selection Matters

Choosing the wrong model can lead to:
- High costs  
- Poor performance  
- Slow response times  
- Compliance risks  

> Model selection is not about choosing the most powerful model, but the most appropriate one for the use case.

## 🧩 Types of Models

### 1. Closed-source Models (API-based)

Examples:
- OpenAI GPT models  
- Google Gemini  
- Azure OpenAI  

---

#### Characteristics

- High performance  
- Managed infrastructure  
- Easy to integrate  

---

#### Pros

- State-of-the-art performance  
- No infrastructure management  
- Fast setup  

---

#### Cons

- Costly at scale  
- Limited customization  
- Vendor lock-in  

---

## 🔓 2. Open-source Models

Examples:
- LLaMA (Meta)  
- Mistral  
- Falcon  

---

#### Characteristics

- Self-hosted or cloud-hosted  
- Fully customizable  

---

#### Pros

- Lower cost at scale  
- Full control  
- Custom fine-tuning  

---

#### Cons

- Requires infrastructure  
- Setup complexity  
- Performance may vary  

---

## ⚖️ Closed vs Open-source

| Criteria | Closed Models | Open-source Models |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Setup | Easy | Complex |
| Cost | High (per API) | Lower (infra cost) |
| Performance | High | Varies |
| Control | Limited | Full |
| Latency | Low (managed) | Depends on infra |

---

## 🎯 When to Use What

### Use Closed Models When:
- Fast prototyping  
- High accuracy needed  
- No infra setup required  

---

### Use Open-source When:
- Cost optimization required  
- Data privacy is critical  
- Customization is needed  

---

## 💡 Key Insight

> Start with closed models for speed, then evaluate open-source for cost and control at scale.

## 🎯 Model Selection Criteria

Choosing a model requires evaluating multiple dimensions.

---

### 1. Accuracy

#### 📌 Definition
How well the model performs on the task.

---

#### Considerations

- Domain performance (medical, legal, general)  
- Reasoning capability  
- Hallucination tendency  

---

#### Evaluation Methods

- Benchmark datasets  
- Human evaluation  
- Task-specific testing  

---

## ⚡ 2. Latency

### 📌 Definition
Time taken to generate a response.

---

### Factors Affecting Latency

- Model size  
- Input/output token length  
- Infrastructure (API vs self-hosted)  

---

### Trade-off

| Low Latency | High Latency |
|------------|-------------|
| Faster responses | Better reasoning |
| Smaller models | Larger models |

---

## 💰 3. Cost

### 📌 Definition
Cost per request or per token usage.

---

### Cost Factors

- Input tokens  
- Output tokens  
- Model pricing tier  

---

### Example

```
Cost = (Input Tokens + Output Tokens) × Price per Token
```

---

### Optimization Strategies

- Reduce token usage  
- Use smaller models  
- Cache responses  
- Use model routing  

---

## 📏 4. Context Window

### 📌 Definition
Maximum number of tokens a model can process.

---

### Importance

- Larger context → more information  
- Smaller context → faster and cheaper  

---

### Example

| Context Size | Use Case |
|-------------|---------|
| 4K | Short queries |
| 32K | Documents |
| 100K+ | Large context (RAG) |

---

## 🧪 Benchmarking Strategy

### 📌 Why Benchmark?

To compare models objectively.

---

### Steps

1. Define task  
2. Create evaluation dataset  
3. Run multiple models  
4. Measure metrics:
   - Accuracy  
   - Latency  
   - Cost  
5. Compare results  

---

### Example

```
Task: Extract biomarkers

Model A:
Accuracy: 85%
Latency: 500ms
Cost: Low

Model B:
Accuracy: 92%
Latency: 1200ms
Cost: High
```

---

### Decision

- High accuracy required → Model B  
- Cost-sensitive → Model A  

---

## ⚖️ Trade-offs

| Factor | Trade-off |
|-------|----------|
| Accuracy vs Cost | Higher accuracy → higher cost |
| Latency vs Quality | Faster → less reasoning |
| Context vs Cost | Larger context → more tokens |

---

## 💡 Key Insight

> Model selection is a multi-dimensional optimization problem involving accuracy, latency, cost, and context.

## 🔀 Model Routing

### 📌 Definition

Model routing is the practice of dynamically selecting different models based on:
- Task complexity  
- Cost constraints  
- Latency requirements  

---

### Why Model Routing is Needed

Using a single large model for all requests:
- Increases cost  
- Wastes compute  
- Reduces efficiency  

---

### Example

```
Simple query → Small model  
Complex reasoning → Large model  
```

---

### Routing Strategies

#### 1. Rule-based Routing

```
if query_length < threshold:
    use_small_model()
else:
    use_large_model()
```

---

#### 2. Confidence-based Routing

- Start with smaller model  
- Escalate if confidence is low  

---

#### 3. Task-based Routing

| Task | Model |
|------|------|
| Extraction | Small model |
| Reasoning | Large model |
| Summarization | Medium model |

---

## 🧱 Multi-model Architecture

### 📌 Definition

Using multiple models in a pipeline for different tasks.

---

### Example Pipeline

```
User Query
  → Small Model (classification)
  → Retrieval System (RAG)
  → Large Model (final answer)
```

---

### Benefits

- Cost optimization  
- Better performance  
- Scalability  

---

### Example Use Case

```
PDF Processing:
- OCR → external tool
- Extraction → small model
- Explanation → large model
```

---

## ⚖️ Fine-tuning vs Prompting vs RAG

### 1. Prompt Engineering

#### Use When:
- Quick iteration needed  
- No training data available  

---

### 2. Fine-tuning

#### Use When:
- Domain-specific knowledge required  
- Consistent output format needed  

---

### 3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

#### Use When:
- Data is dynamic  
- Knowledge changes frequently  

---

### Comparison

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---------|------|------|
| Prompting | Fast | Limited control |
| Fine-tuning | High control | Expensive |
| RAG | Dynamic | Retrieval complexity |

---

## 🏭 Real-world Decision Patterns

### Pattern 1: Start Simple

- Begin with prompting  
- Add RAG if needed  
- Fine-tune only if required  

---

### Pattern 2: Cost-first Optimization

- Use smallest model possible  
- Scale up only when needed  

---

### Pattern 3: Hybrid Systems

Combine:
- LLM  
- Retrieval  
- Rules  
- ML models  

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

- Using large models for all tasks  
- Ignoring cost implications  
- Overusing fine-tuning  
- Not evaluating multiple models  
- No fallback strategy  

---

## 💡 Key Insight

> The best system does not use the most powerful model everywhere — it uses the right model at the right place.
